        A croissant is a French pastry in a crescent shape made from a laminated
        yeast dough similar to puff pastry. It is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie
        pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl, but using the
        French yeast-leavened laminated dough. Croissants are named for their
        historical crescent shape. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and
        folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a
        technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky
        texture, similar to a puff pastry. Crescent-shaped breads have been made
        since the Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since
        antiquity.The modern croissant was developed in the early 20th century,
        when French bakers replaced the brioche dough of the kipferl with a
        yeast-leavened laminated dough.[ In the late 1970s, the development of
        factory-made, frozen, preformed but unbaked dough made them into a fast
        food that could be freshly baked by unskilled labor. The croissant
        bakery, notably the La Croissanterie chain, was a French response to
        American-style fast food, and as of 2008, 30–40% of the croissants sold
        in French bakeries and patisseries were baked from frozen dough.
        Croissants are a common part of a continental breakfast in many European
        countries.
